### Feature
Per-episode `length_minutes` and `speaker` overrides on `POST /episodes`.
- **`api/schemas.py`** — added `length_minutes` (int, validated 3–30) and `speaker` (str) fields to `CreateEpisodeRequest`
- **`api/routes/episodes.py`** — INSERT stores both new fields as `length_minutes` and `speaker_override`
- **`studio/generator.py`** — `process_episode` SELECTs and applies both overrides; `generate_transcript` accepts `speaker_override`, looks up speaker from `SPEAKER_PROFILES` instead of show default when set; `length_override` passed to `build_briefing_packet`
- **`alembic/versions/0008_episode_overrides.py`** — migration adding `length_minutes INTEGER` and `speaker_override TEXT` columns to the `episode` table

### Feature
edge-tts integration — free TTS with no API key required.
- **`core/llm_config/schema.py`** — added `"edge_tts"` to `ProviderType` Literal
- **`core/llm_config/adapters/tts.py`** — added `output_format` property (`"mp3"` for edge_tts, `"wav"` otherwise); added early bypass of API key check for edge_tts; added `_synthesize_edge_tts()` using `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a fresh event loop to avoid `asyncio.run()` conflict with the async worker
- **`core/tts.py`** — `synthesize_for_speaker` now returns `str` (the output format) instead of `None`
- **`studio/generator.py`** — stitcher detects MP3 vs WAV from `synthesize_line_by_speaker` return value and calls `from_mp3()` or `from_wav()` accordingly
- **`config/models.yaml`** — added `edge_tts` provider, `edge-tts` model alias, updated all speaker bindings (kenji, arjun, emeka) to use edge-tts Neural voices

### Bug Fix
- **`api/routes/sources.py`** — fixed crash on `DELETE /sources/{id}`: FastAPI requires `response_class=Response` for 204 routes; changed return to `Response(status_code=204)`
- **`api/routes/admin.py`** — same 204 fix for `DELETE /examples/{example_id}`
- **`studio/generator.py`** — fixed `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'judge'`: changed import to `from optimization.rubrics.judge import judge as _rubric_judge` and removed `.judge` from all call sites

### Docs
- **`TEST_PLAN.md`** — created full test plan (TC-1 through TC-17) with testing strategy, agent orchestration guide, dependency graph, and self-discovery snippets
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — created with changelog rule, project overview, and stack reference for any agent picking up this codebase
